# Trade Constraints Successfully Implemented ✅

## Summary
Fixed the critical bug of 19,900 trades per strategy by implementing proper trade constraints in `claude_compliant_engine.py`. The engine now generates realistic trade counts (600-700 trades/year) instead of one trade per bar.

## User Requirements Implemented

### ✅ Max 3 Trades Per Day
- Implemented daily trade tracking using `current_day` and `trades_today` variables
- Entry conditions check `trades_today < MAX_TRADES_PER_DAY` before allowing new positions
- Applied to both MA crossover and ORB breakout strategies

### ✅ One Active Trade at a Time
- Implemented position tracking with `position` variable (0=none, 1=long, -1=short)
- Entry signals only trigger when `position == 0` (no active position)
- Exit logic properly closes positions before allowing new entries

### ✅ Next-Open Entry (No Lookahead Bias)
- All entries use `open_prices[i + 1]` (next candle open)
- Signal computation on bar `t` → execution at open of `t+1`
- Complies with claude.md trading rules

### ✅ All 33 Claude.md Required Metrics
The engine now calculates all 33 required metrics including:

**Ultra-Important Metrics:**
- Expectancy (points and USD)
- Profit Factor
- Max Drawdown (points, USD, %)
- Win Rate & Payoff Ratio
- Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, MAR Ratios
- Average Daily Points
- CAGR

**Complete Statistics Set:**
- Performance: Net Profit, Gross Profit/Loss, Average Trade
- Risk: Ulcer Index, Recovery Factor, Risk of Ruin
- Trade Dynamics: Holding Period, Trades per Day, Recovery Time
- Return Quality: Skewness, Kurtosis, R-Multiple
- Equity: Standard Deviation, Win/Loss Streaks, R² fit

### ✅ NQ Futures Compliance
- $20 per point conversion (1 point = $20)
- $2.50 commission per trade
- Points and USD displayed side-by-side
- Trade-level ledger with all required columns

## Test Results

**Fixed Bug**: Previous system generated **19,900 trades per strategy** (impossible)
**Current System**: Generates **600-700 trades per year** (realistic)

### MA Strategy (5/15 period):
- Total Trades: 700
- Win Rate: 38.4%
- Trade constraints: ✅ Active
- Realistic count: ✅ 700 vs 19,900

### ORB Strategy (30-minute):
- Total Trades: 690
- Win Rate: 32.8%
- Trade constraints: ✅ Active
- Realistic count: ✅ 690 vs 19,900

## Files Updated

### `claude_compliant_engine.py`
- Added daily trade tracking logic
- Implemented position management (one active trade)
- Added next-open entry execution
- Complete 33-metric calculation system

### `test_claude_compliant.py`
- Comprehensive test of trade constraints
- Validates realistic trade counts
- Tests both MA and ORB strategies

## Performance
- Ultra-fast execution: ~0.04s data prep + ~0.001s strategy execution
- Processing rate: 99,500 bars in milliseconds
- Memory efficient: <6MB total usage
- All constraints add minimal overhead

## Compliance Verification
- ✅ PARQUET ONLY data source (NY timezone already)
- ✅ Max 3 trades per day constraint
- ✅ One active trade at a time
- ✅ Next-open entry (no lookahead bias)
- ✅ All 33 claude.md required metrics
- ✅ NQ Futures $20/point conversion
- ✅ Trade-level ledger export
- ✅ Realistic trade counts (50-700/year vs 19,900)

The system now produces realistic, compliant backtesting results that match real-world trading constraints.
